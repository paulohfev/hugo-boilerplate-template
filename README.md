# hugo-boilerplate-template

### About

This is a simple boilerplate template containing basic configuration for a Hugo-based project. <br>
For basic configuration covered, we have:
1. assets directory and setup in the `head.html` partial
2. `baseof.html` setup with `head.html`, `header.html` and `footer.html` imported and to be shared across all pages

### Requirements

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- To install Hugo according to your machine's specs, please refer to its oficial documentation covering installation - [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
- Be sure to install Hugo with the **“extended”** Sass/SCSS version, as this boilerplate has a basic Sass/SCSS setup.

### Run the project
1. Run the command `hugo server -D` in your terminal;
2. Go to your browser and access `http://localhost:1313`;
